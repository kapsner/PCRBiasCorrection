`rBiasCorrection` is published in *'BiasCorrector: fast and accurate correction of all types of experimental biases in quantitative DNA methylation data derived by different technologies' (2021)* in the *International Journal of Cancer* (DOI: [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ijc.33681](https://doi.org/10.1002/ijc.33681)).

`rBiasCorrection` is the R implementation with minor modifications of the algorithms described by Moskalev et al. in their research article *'Correction of PCR-bias in quantitative DNA methylation studies by means of cubic polynomial regression'*, published 2011 in *Nucleic acids research, Oxford University Press* (DOI: [https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkr213](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkr213)).  

# Installation

## CRAN version

You can install `rBiasCorrection` simply with via R's `install.packages` interface:

```{r}
#| eval: false
install.packages("rBiasCorrection")
```

## Development version

If you want to use the latest development version, you can install the github version of `rBiasCorrection` with:

```{r}
#| eval: false
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("kapsner/rBiasCorrection")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to correct PCR-bias in quantitative DNA methylation data:

```{r}
#| eval: false
library(rBiasCorrection)

# define input file paths
experimental <- file.path(tempdir(), "/experimental_data.csv")
calibration <- file.path(tempdir(), "/calibration_data.csv")

# create example files from provided example dataset
data.table::fwrite(
  rBiasCorrection::example.data_experimental$dat,
  experimental
)
data.table::fwrite(
  rBiasCorrection::example.data_calibration$dat,
  calibration
)

# run bias correction algorithm
biascorrection(
  experimental = experimental,
  calibration = calibration,
  samplelocusname = "BRAF"
)
```

More detailed information on how to use the package `rBiasCorrection` can be found in the [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rBiasCorrection/vignettes/rBiasCorrection_howto.html) and the [FAQs](https://github.com/kapsner/rBiasCorrection/blob/master/FAQ.md).

## Available Fitting Options (TODO)

There are three fitting options available for fitting the non-linear least squares (nls) algorithm with `rBiasCorrection`. The default method (used in the publication) is to fit nls with the Gauss-Newton algorithm and define for each parameter that should be optimized a random grid between -1000 and 1000 for initializing the starting estimates (`options(rBiasCorrection.nls_implementation = "GN.paper")`.  
For making a better guess on the starting estimates when fitting nls with the Gauss-Newton algorithm (`options(rBiasCorrection.nls_implementation = "GN.guess")`), the estimates of a linear model (for both hyperbolic corrections) and of a cubic model (for the cubic correction with defined minimum- and maximum values (`minmax = TRUE`)) are computed for initializing the nls (see details below).  
The third option is to fit nls with the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (using the implementation from the `minpack.lm` R package). In this case, the start estimates of the nls model are also guessed using either a linear or a cubic model (as previously described).

### `GN.paper`

Algorithm: Gauss-Newton

Parameterizing `nls2::nls2()` with starting values:

- hyperbolic equation: a = b = d = c(-1000, 1000)
- hyperbolic equation (minmax): b = c(-1000, 1000)
- cubic equation (minmax): a, b = c(-1000, 1000)

```{r}
#| eval: false
options(rBiasCorrection.nls_implementation = "GN.paper")
```

### `GN.guess`

Algorithm: Gauss-Newton

Parameterizing `nls2::nls2()` with starting values:

- hyperbolic equation: fitting a linear regression and taking the intercept and the beta as starting values and defaulting `d` to `1000`
- hyperbolic equation (minmax): fitting a linear regression and taking the beta as starting value
- cubic equation (minmax): fitting a cubic regression and taking the betas for the cubic and the quadratic term as starting values

```{r}
#| eval: false
options(rBiasCorrection.nls_implementation = "GN.guess")
```

### `LM`

Algorithm: Levenberg-Marquardt

Parameterizing `minpack.lm::nlsLM()` with starting values: same as guessing starting values for option `GN.guess`

```{r}
#| eval: false
options(rBiasCorrection.nls_implementation = "LM")
```
